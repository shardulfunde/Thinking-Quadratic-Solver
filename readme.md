# Thinking Quadratic Solver

**Thinking Quadratic Solver** is a Python program that solves quadratic equations in a unique and entertaining way. Instead of immediately providing results, the program mimics "thinking" by displaying thoughtful prompts and pauses, making the solving process interactive and engaging.

## Features
- Solves quadratic equations of the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`.
- Mimics human-like "thinking" with random delays and thoughtful prompts.
- Provides real roots if the discriminant is non-negative; otherwise, indicates no real solutions.
- A fun and interactive way to visualize how quadratic equations are solved.

## How It Works
1. The user provides the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` for the quadratic equation.
2. The program calculates the discriminant `b² - 4ac` with a simulated "thinking" process.
3. If the discriminant is non-negative, it calculates and displays the roots.
4. If the discriminant is negative, it informs the user that no real roots exist.

## Example Usage
Run the program and follow the prompts:

```plaintext
This program solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
You will need to input the values for a, b, and c, where:
  - a is the coefficient of x^2 (quadratic term)
  - b is the coefficient of x (linear term)
  - c is the constant term

Enter coefficient a: 1
Enter coefficient b: -3
Enter coefficient c: 2

Now calculating the discriminant...
Calculating the discriminant...
Breaking down the b² part...
Multiplying 4 with 'a' and 'c'...

Discriminant is 1.0
Type any key to proceed further:

Hmm, let me think about this for a second...
Analyzing this carefully...

Roots of quadratic equation are 2.0 and 1.0
